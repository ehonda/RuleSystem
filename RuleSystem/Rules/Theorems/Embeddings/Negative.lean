-- TODO: Adjust text for the proof idea, it's not quite accurate
-- ðŸ”® (EN-1)
-- Proof idea is as follows: We show that there is an instance captured by the embedded rule that is not captured by
-- embedding the rule captures. To see why this is true, consider the following example:
--
--  * `universe = {A, B, C}, rule = negative {B}`
--  * `inst = âŸ¨{A, D}âŸ©`
--
-- We can capture `inst` with the embedded rule, since `{B} âˆ© {A, D} = âˆ…`, but we can't get `{A, D}` from embedding any
-- of the captures of the original rule, as `{D}` is the last element of the universe embedded into, which we can't get
-- via `castSucc`.
-- Note that it works for the untagged rule as well, where we can just use `inst = ({D})` in the above example.
